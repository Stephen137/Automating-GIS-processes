# Automating-GIS-processes
Geographic data analysis using Python from the course developed at the Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki, Finland.

After completing this course, a student is able to manage, analyse, and visualise spatial data efficiently and in a systematic manner, using Python. They also know how to evaluate available methods critically. Besides learning how to handle, manipulate, and analyse geographic data (e.g., read and write files, manage coordinate reference systems, conduct overlay analysis or network analysis), students also get to know good programming practices, the benefits of using a version control system (git), and how to document and communicate their analysis workflow in an online repository (GitHub).
